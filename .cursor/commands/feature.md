# feature

You are building features for an Electron + React image editor.

Before writing code:
1. Explain implementation plan briefly.
2. Specify which files will be modified.
3. Keep architecture intact.
4. Avoid unnecessary abstractions.

Then provide full working code.

Rules:
- Do not break IPC structure.
- Use existing project patterns.
- Keep UI simple.
- Prioritize stability.
